DESCRIPTION
dbgrep is a database command, which searches a database for matching entries and displays them in the console.
The complete row where the match was found is displayed and the matching element is highlighted in red.
Before using the command you have to start your database and create a folder 'connection_profiles' in the directory where the jar file is located.
Add a connection profile of your database there.

Example connection profile, spaces are ignored:
host=localhost
port=5432
database=test
user=test
password=test
driver=postgresql

SUPPORTED DATABASES
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
